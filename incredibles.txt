ncredible: Is this on?

Interviewer: Thats fine.

Mr. Incredible: I can break through walls, I just cant

Interviewer: Thats fine.

Mr. Incredible: I cant get this on.

Interviewer: So, Mr. Incredible do you have a secret identity?

Mr. Incredible: Every superhero has a secret identity. I dont know a single one who doesnt. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?

Elastigirl: Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Whod want to go shopping as Elastigirl, yknow what I mean?

Frozone: Superladies, theyre always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think itll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, "Girl, I dont want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego." or anything like that. I mean, you tell me youre a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, thats all right with me. Im good. Im good.

Mr. Incredible: No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?

Interviewer: I could get to that point.

Mr. Incredible: Please?

Interviewer: Wait, no, dont get up. Were not finished.

Mr. Incredible: Sometimes l think Id just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family.

Elastigirl: Settle down? Are you kidding? Im at the top of my game! Im right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I dont think so. I dont think so.

SCENE 2
Police Radio: We interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave.

Mr. Incredible: Yeah, Ive got time.

Old Lady: Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible

Mr. Incredible: What is it, maam?

Old Lady: My cat, Squeaker, wont come down.

[cat meows]

Mr. Incredible: Certainly, maam but I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble.

Old Lady: No, no. Hes quite tame.

Mr. Incredible: Let go now!

[cat yowls]

Police Officer 1: Thank you, Mr. lncredible. Youve done it again.

Police Officer 2: Yeah, youre the best.

Mr. Incredible: No, Im just here to help.

Police Radio: Attention all units. We have a tour bus robbery

Mr. Incredible: Tour bus robbery. Ive still got time. Officers. Maam. Squeaker.

[Mr. Incredible gets into his car]

Incrediboy: Cool! Ready for take-off!

Mr. Incredible: What the? Who are you supposed to be?

Incrediboy: Well, Im lncrediBoy.

Mr. Incredible: What? No. Youre that kid from the fan club. [stammering] Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!

Incrediboy: My name is lncrediBoy.

Mr. Incredible: Look, Ive been nice, Ive stood for photos, signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me but this is

Incrediboy: No, you dont have to worry about training me. I know all your moves, your crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! Im your number one fan!

[Mr. Incredible kicks him out of the car and accelerates.]

Incrediboy: Hey! Hey, wait!

SCENE 3
Mr. Incredible: You know... you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse, but maybe thats not what you had in mind.

Thief: Hey, look- (he gets knocked out by a hand)

Mr. Incredible: Elastigirl.

Elastigirl: Mr. lncredible.

Mr. Incredible: No, its all right. Ive got him.

Elastigirl: Sure, youve got him. I just took him out for you.

Mr. Incredible: Sure, you took him out. His attention was on me.

Elastigirl: A fact I exploited to do my job.

Mr. Incredible: My job, you mean.

Elastigirl: A simple thank you will suffice.

Mr. Incredible: Thanks, but I dont need any help.

Elastigirl: Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

Mr. Incredible: Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?

Thief: Hey, look, the lady got me first....(Ironically, he gets knocked out again by Elastigirl.)

Elastigirl: Well, we could share, you know.

Mr. Incredible: I work alone.

Elastigirl: Well, I think you need to be more flexible.

Mr. Incredible: Are you doing anything later?

Elastigirl: I have a previous engagement.

Mr. Incredible: [whistles]

[Later]

Mr. Incredible: Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour.

Frozone: Hey, Incredible!

Mr. Incredible: Hey, Frozone!

Frozone: Shouldnt you be getting ready?

Mr. Incredible: I still got time.

[crowd screaming]

Woman: Hes gonna jump!

[Mr. Incredible then watches Sansweet jump down, with the croud's screaming magnified. He runs forward, and catches him just in time as he runs into the building.]

Sansweet: I think you broke something.

Mr. Incredible: With counseling, I think youll come to forgive me. Wait a minute.

[He drags him to safety, and hears noises from the wall. He takes cover with the Seal Door, as a bomb explodes, leaving smoke and a hole in the wall. Bomb Voyage emerges from the hole.]

Mr. Incredible: [coughing] Bomb Voyage!

Bomb Voyage: Monsieur Incroyable! (Mr. Incredible)!

Incrediboy: And IncrediBoy!

Bomb Voyage: IncrediBoy?

Incrediboy: Hey, hey! Arent you curious about how I get around so fast? See? I have these rocket boots--

Mr. Incredible: Go home, Buddy.

Incrediboy: What?

Mr. Incredible: Now.

Bomb Voyage: Petit mufle va! (Little oaf)!

Incrediboy: Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well, Ive finally figured out who I am. I am your wardlncrediBoy!

Mr. Incredible: And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy.

Incrediboy: This is because I dont have powers, isnt it? Well not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?

Mr. Incredible: Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

Bomb Voyage: Oui et ta tenue est compl√®tement ridicule! (And your outfit is totally ridiculous!)

Incrediboy: Just give me one chance! Ill show you. Ill go get the police.

Mr. Incredible: Buddy, dont!

Incrediboy: Itll only take a second, really.

Mr. Incredible: No, STOP! Theres a bomb!

Incrediboy: Let go! Youre wrecking my flight pattern! I can do this if you let go!

Mr. Incredible: Will you just? Im trying to help! Stop!

Incrediboy: Let go of my cape!

[He does, as the bomb drops onto a train track below. It then explodes, destroying a huge chunk of the bridge.]

[A train was approaching, and Mr. Incredible runs forward to it, stops, and lets the train hit his hands. The train does, as the passengers brutally get thrown forward, and the train slowly comes to a halt, almost falling down the bridge.]

SCENE 4
Mr. Incredible: Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what hes been doing.

Incrediboy: I can help you. Youre making a mista--- HEY!

Mr. Incredible: The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?

Police Officer: Theyve already picked him up.

Mr. Incredible: The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I caught in the act robbing the vault. Now, we might be able to nab him if we set up a perimeter.

Police Officer: You mean he got away?

Mr. Incredible: Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that.

Incrediboy: INCREDIBOY.

Mr. Incredible: Youre not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, Im late. Listen, Ive gotta be somewhere.

Police Officer: What about Bomb Voyage?

Mr. Incredible: Any other night, Id go after him myself, but I really gotta go. But dont worry. Well get him! Eventually!

SCENE 5
Bob: Is the night still young?

Lucius: Youre very late.

Bob: How do I look? Good?

Lucius: Oh, the mask! You still got the mask. (He takes Bob's mask off.)

[cracks neck]

Bob: Showtime. (He proceeds to enter the church.)

Priest: Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?

Helen: Youre late. When you asked me if I was doing anything later, I didnt realize youd actually forgotten. I thought it was playful banter.

Bob: It was playful banter.

Helen: Cutting it kinda close, dont you think?

Bob: You need to be more...flexible.

Helen: I love you, but if were gonna make this work, youve gotta be more than Mr. Incredible. You know that. Dont you?

Priest: ...so long as you both shall live?

Bob: I do.

Priest: I pronounce this couple husband and wife.

[They kiss, as people are cheering and whistling. Gazerbeam, Stratogale, Dynaguy, Meta Man, Thunderhead, E and Rick Dicker can be seen for a few seconds clapping.]

Helen: As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens.

Bob: Hey, come on. Were superheroes. What could happen?

[The screen switches to a news flash.]

Announcer: In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didnt want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed a suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court.

Sansweets Lawyer: Mr. Sansweet didnt ask to be saved, Mr. Sansweet didnt want to be saved! And the injury received from Mr. Incredibles "action", so quote, causes him daily pain!

Mr. Incredible: Hey, I saved your life!

Sansweet: You didnt save my life, you ruined my death! Thats what you did...!

Mr. Incredible: Listen, you little [interrupted by his lawyer] piece of....

Mr. Incredible's Lawyer: My client has no further comment at this time.

Announcer: Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Mr. Incredibles court losses costed the government millions, and opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over.

Judge: It is time for their secret identities to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away!

Announcer: Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work.

Announcer: Where are they now?

Announcer: They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.

SCENE 6
(15 YEARS LATER)

Mrs. Hogenson: Denied? Youre denying my claim? I dont understand....I have full coverage!

Bob: Im sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 17. It states clearly-

Mrs. Hogenson [stammering] I cant pay for this!

[phone rings]

Bob: Excuse me. [answers phone] Claims, Bob Parr.

Helen: Im calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. Were now officially moved in.

Bob: Yeah, well, thats great, honey. And the last three years dont count because...

Helen: Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, its official. Ha, ha, ha. Why do we have so much junk?

Bob: Listen, honey, Ive got a client.

Helen: Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey. Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids from school. See you tonight.

Bob: Bye, honey. (To Mrs. Hogenson) Excuse me. Where were we?

Mrs. Hogenson: [sobbing] Im on a fixed income, and if you cant help me, I dont know what Ill do. [blows nose loudly] [sobbing]

Bob: All right, listen closely. Id like to help you, but I cant. Id like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I cant. I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal department on the second floor. I wouldnt expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. Id like to help, but theres nothing I can do.

Mrs. Hogenson: Oh, thank you, young man.

Bob: Shhh! [shouting] Im sorry, maam! I know youre upset! [whispering] Pretend to be upset.

(Mrs. Hogenson sobs away. Mr. Huph was coming)

Mr. Huph: ....PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!

(he throws some papers at Bob's desk, as he gets startled)

Mr. Huph: YOU AUTHORIZED PAYMENT ON THE WALKER POLICY?!?!

Bob: Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. Their policy clearly covers....

Mr. Huph: I..I-I-I dont wanna know about their coverage, Bob! Dont tell me about their coverage! Tell me how youre keeping Insuricare in the black! Tell me how thats possible, with you writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory THAT GIVES YOU A PHONE CALL!!!!

(Mr. Huph walks away)

PA Announcement: Morning break is over. Morning break is over.

SCENE 7
Principal: I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr.

Helen: Whats this about? Has Dash done something wrong?

Bernie: Hes a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class.

Dash: He says.

Bernie: Look, I know its you! He puts thumb tacks on my stool.

Helen: You saw him do this?

Bernie: Well... not really... No! Actually, not.

Helen: Oh, then how do you know it was him?

Bernie: I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You dont see it? (he sighs, and rewinds the tape) He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! (he rewinds again) Right....there! Right as I'm sitting down! (as he said there, Dash flickered back to his desk on a split second) I dont know how he does it, but theres no tack on my stool before he moves and after he moves, theres a tack! Coincidence? I think NOT!

Principal: Uh....Bernie.....(he pats his shoulder)

Bernie: Dont "Bernie" me! [screaming] THIS LITTLE RAT IS GUILTY!!!!!!!

Principal: You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. Im sorry for the trouble.

Bernie: Youre letting him go again?! Hes guilty! You can see it on his smug little face! GUILTY, I SAY, GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!!!!! (as he shakes the chair)

(Later, at the car trip home

Helen: Dash, this is the third time this year youve been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more....constructive outlet.

Dash: Maybe I could, if youd let me go out for sports.

Helen: Honey, you know why we cant do that.

Dash: I promise Ill slow up. Ill only be the best by a tiny bit.

Helen: Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation.

Dash: You always say, Do your best. But you dont really mean it. Why cant I do the best that I can do?

Helen: Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else.

Dash: Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special.

Helen: Everyones special, Dash.

Dash: Which is another way of saying no one is.

Boy: Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed?

Girl: Hi, Tony.

Tony: Hey.

Boy: Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?

Tony: Thats kind of funny.

Boy 1: Hey, Tony, do you play football?

Boy 2: Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming.

Violet: He looked at me.

[car horn honking]

Dash: Come on, Violet!

[Bob is on a interstate highway, heading home from Insuricare.]

[He slowly arrives with his under-sized hatchback. When he opens the door, he slips on a skate and leaves a finger crush on the door.]

Bob: [muttering] Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway. [He notices his finger crush on the door.] Oh, great.

(Bob attempts to shut the car door with increasing frustration. The third time he quickly throws it closed, only for the door window to crack and shatter. He loses his temper and lifts the car over his head, only to see a child on a tricycle staring at him. The child's bubblegum bubble pops. Bob puts the car down, and checks for the kid. And goes back in the house.)

SCENE 8
Dash: Mom. Youre making weird faces again.

Helen: Mmm.... No, I'm not.

Bob: You make weird faces, honey.

Helen: Do you have to read at the table?

Bob: Uh-huh. Yeah.

Helen: Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat?

Dash: Ow.

Helen: Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school?

Dash: [nervously] Well, we dissected a frog.

Helen: Dash got sent to the office again.

Bob: [distracted] Good. Good.

Helen: No Bob, that's bad.

Bob: What?

Helen: Dash got sent to the office again.

Bob: What?! What for?

Dash: Nothing.

Helen: He put a tack on the teachers chair...during class.

Dash: Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape.

Bob: They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast did you think were you going?

Helen: Bob! We are not encouraging this.

Bob: Im not encouraging, Im just asking how fast...

Helen: Honey!

[Bob cuts through the plate and table, causing it to collapse]

Bob: Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table...

Helen: The car? What happened to the car?

Bob: Here. Im getting a new plate. [He leaves angrily]

Helen: So, how about you, Vi? How was school?

Violet: Nothing to report.

Helen: Youve hardly touched your food.

Violet: Im not hungry for meatloaf.

Helen: Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are you hungry for?

Dash: Tony Rydinger.

Violet: Shut up!

Dash: Well, you are.

Violet: I said, SHUT UP, you little insect!

Dash: Well, she is.

Helen: Do not shout at the table. Honey!

Bob: (off screen) Kids! Listen to your mother.

(Helen sighs and the family goes back to eating dinner)

Dash: Shed eat if we were having "Tony loaf".

Violet: THAT'S IT!

[Dash and Violet start fighting]

Helen: Stop it!

Dash: Youre gonna be toast!

Helen: Stop running in the house! You sit down!

Dash: OW!! Hey, no force fields!

Violet: You started it. Helen: You sit down! You sit down! Violet!

[...]

Bob: "Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing." Gazerbeam.

Helen: (off screen) BOB!!!! IT'S TIME TO ENGAGE!!! (back on screen) Do something! Dont just stand there! I need you to... intervene!!

Bob: You want me to intervene? Okay! Im intervening, Im intervening! [He picks up the table, so does Helen, with the kids still fighting.]

Helen: Violet, let go of your brother!

[The doorbell rings.]

Jack Jack: Hello?

[...]

Bob: Get the door.

[The family quickly goes back to their regular positions except for Dash, who runs over to answer the door.]

Dash: Hey, Lucius!

Lucius: Hey, Speedo! Hey, Helen. Vi, Jack-Jack.

[Dash runs back to his seat at the table]

Bob: He-hey! Ice of you to drop by.

Lucius: Ha! Never heard that one before.

Dash [gargling]: Oh, Lucius! [He spits water in the air.]

Lucius: WHOA! [He freezes the spit shot and catches it.]

Dash: Aw... I like it when it shatters.

Bob: Ill be back later.

Helen: Hey, where are you two going?

Bob: Its Wednesday.

Helen: Right. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

Lucius: Will do, love. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids.

Helen: Dont think youve avoided talking about your trip to the principals office, young man. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it.

Dash: Im not the only kid whos been sent to the office, you know.

Helen: Other kids dont have superpowers. Now, its perfectly normal...

Violet: Normal? What do you know about normal!? What does ANYONE in this family know about normal?

Helen: Now, wait a minute, young lady.

Violet: We ACT normal, mom! I wanna BE normal! The only normal one is Jack-Jack! And hes not even toilet trained! [Jack-Jack laughs]

Dash: Lucky... Oh, I meant about being normal.

SCENE 9
Lucius: So now Im in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and Im an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find cover and what does Baron Von Ruthless do?

Bob: He starts monologuing.

Lucius: He starts monologuing. He starts like this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada.

Bob: Yammering.

Lucius: Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he wont shut up.

POLICE RADIO: Municiberg, we have a 23-56...

Bob: 23-56, what is that? Robbery?

Lucius: This is just sad.

Bob: Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber?

Lucius: No. Tell you the truth, Id rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think were doing? Just to shake things up.

[Meanwhile, on an undercover car....]

Mirage: Hes not alone. The fat guys still with him. Theyre just talking.

[Back on Lucius's car]

Lucius: What are we doing here, Bob?

Bob: Protecting people.

Lucius: Nobody asked us.

Bob: You need an invitation?

Lucius: Id like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam?

Bob: Yeah. There was something about him in the paper.

Lucius: He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too.

Bob: Whens the last time you saw him?

Lucius:I dont see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And were pushing our luck as it is.

Bob: Oh, come on.

Lucius: It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, were gonna get--

Police Radio: We have a report on a fire...

Bob: A fire. Were close! [yelling] YEAH, BABY!!!!!!

Lucius: Were gonna get caught.

Bob: WOOOHOO!

[Lucius reluctantly drives forward...]

Bob: Fire! Yeah!

[...as the undercover car follows them both.]

[The camera pans through the inside of a burning building, and then centers on Lucius and Bob, who are both carrying several people over their shoulders]

Lucius: Is that everybody!?

Bob: Yeah, thats everyone!

Lucius: It better be. [He attempts to generate ice in vain)

Bob: Cant you put this out?

Lucius: I cant lay down a layer thick enough! Its evaporating too fast!

Bob: Well, whats that mean?!

Lucius: It MEANS its hot! And Im dehydrated, Bob!

Bob: Youre out of ice?! You cant run out of ice! I thought you can use water in the air!

Lucius: There IS no water in this air! Whats YOUR excuse, run out of muscle?!?!

Bob: I just cant go smashing into walls! The buildings getting weaker by the second! Its gonna come down on top of us!

Lucius: I wanted to go bowling!!

Bob: All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!

[Bob turns to his side and begins to run with Lucius following him. They crash through the side of the building into the building next to them. A second outside shot of the burning building shows it collapse.]

Bob: Yeah....

[But he realizes theyre in a jewelry store...]

Bob: Uh-oh.

[...and unknowingly trips the alarm on]

Bob [sarcastically]: Oh, good.

[alarm sounds]

Lucius: Oh, no. That aint right.

[They both start arguing]

Lucius: We look like bad guys! Incompetent bad guys!

Bob: You can get water out of the air!

[Until an officer breaks in]

Police Officer: FREEZE!!!

[They do]

[LUCIUS, noticing a water container, picks up a paper cup and begins to fill it with water]

Police Officer: FREEZE!!!

Lucius: I'm thirsty.

Police Officer: I SAID FREEZE!!!

Lucius: Im just getting a drink.

[He finishes the cup of water and then drops his hands to his sides]

Police Officer: Alright. Youve had your drink. Now I want you to---

Lucius: (Holding up hands in mock surrender) I know. I know.

[...]

Lucius: Freeze.

[He shoots a breeze of ice, freezing the officer and even the bullet]

[police radio chatter]

Police Radio: Shots fired!

Officers: POLICE OFFICERS!!

[They enter the building, guns drawn. One gasps and the others turn to look in his direction. The first officer is encased in ice, a bullet from his gun suspended in midair. Bob and Lucius had gotten away safely.]

Lucius: That was way too close. We are not doing that again.

Police Radio: Verify you want to switch targets? Over.

Mirage: Trust me. This is the one hes been looking for.

SCENE 10
[Bob had arrived home. He picks up a piece of cake from the kitchen while humming, and walks into the living room. A chair swivels around to reveal Helen on her pajamas, almost making Bob throw the piece at her.]

Helen: I thought youd be back by 11.

Bob: I said Id be back later.

Helen: I assumed youd be back later. If you came back at all, youd be "back later".

Bob: Well... Im back, okay?

[Helen then picks up a little rock from Bob's suit.]

Helen: Is this... rubble?

Bob: [with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose.

Helen: You know how I feel about that, Bob! Darn you, We cant blow cover again!

Bob: The building was coming down anyway.

Helen:What!? You knocked down the building!?

Bob: It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down anyway.

Helen:Tell me you havent been listening to the police scanner again....

Bob: Look, I performed a public service. You act like thats a bad thing!

Helen: It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing!

Bob: Reliving the glory days is better than acting like they didnt happen!

Helen: Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is whats happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I cant BELIEVE you dont want to go to your own sons graduation!

Bob: Its not a graduation. Hes moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade.

Helen: Its a ceremony!

Bob: Its psychotic. They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional, then-

Helen: This is not about you, Bob! This is about Dash!

Bob: You want to do something for Dash!? Then let him actually compete! Let him go out for sports!!

Helen: I will not be made the enemy here! You know why we cant do that!!

Bob: BECAUSE HE'D BE GREAT!!!!

Helen: THIS IS NOT!! ABOUT!!!! YOU!!!!!!!!

[Offscreen of the sound of paper falling/rustling is heard. Bob and Helen turn to the couch.]

Bob: Right, Dash. I know youre listening. Come on out.

Helen: Vi, you, too, young lady.

Bob: Come on. Come on out. Its okay, kids. Were just having a discussion.

Violet: Pretty loud discussion.

Bob: Yeah. But thats okay. Because whats important is that Mommy and I are always a team. Were always united against, uh, the forces of, uh...

Helen: Pigheadedness?

Bob: I was gonna say evil or something.

Helen: Were sorry we woke you. Everythings okay. Go back to bed. Its late.

Dash: Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.

Violet: Good night.

Helen: In fact, we should all be in bed.

SCENE 11
Woman [on phone]: Request claim on claim numbers 158183....

[Bob presses his telephone message button.]

Mr. Huph: HAVEN'T YOU GOTTEN HIM, WHERE IS HE!? PLEASE!

Mr. Huph's Secretary: [over the intercom] Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office.

Bob: Now?

Mr. Huph's Secretary: now....

[He eventually gets up from his office and heads to Huph's Office. As a woman slowly walks and leaves something on his desktop.]

[At Huph's Office, he sharpens his Pencil and aligns it with other 3.]

Mr. Huph: Sit down, Bob.

[He does, moving the 4th pencil. Huph re-aligns it and starts.]

Mr. Huph: Im not happy, Bob. Not. HAPPY. [He gets up.] Ask me why.

Bob: Okay. Why?

Mr. Huph: Why what? Be specific, Bob.

Bob: Why are you unhappy?

Mr. Huph: Your customers make me unhappy.

Bob: What, youve gotten complaints?

Mr. Huph: Complaints? I can handle. What I cant handle is your customers inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricares inner workings!! They're experts! EXPERTS, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle! They're PENETRATING the bureaucracy!

Bob: Did I do something illegal?

Mr. Huph [begrudgingly]: no........

Bob: Are you saying we shouldnt help our customers?

Mr. Huph: The law requires that I answer no.

Bob: Were supposed to help people!

Mr. Huph: We're supposed to help OUURRRRRR PEOPLE!!! Starting with our stockholders, Bob! Who's helping them out, huh?! 

[He sighs and regains composure.]

Mr. Huph: You know, Bob....

[He moves a letter that says:]

_

{Memo: Policy Notification}

{To: Employee}

{From: Gilbert Huph}

{Due to financial cut-backs, you will be expected to self-expense all office supplies, including but not limited to pencils, erasers, pens, paper, stationery, folders, staples, paper clips, brads, and photocopies. All parking will now be metered by the hour. Electricity consumption and all telephone charges will be deducted from your paycheck.

The Board of Directors at Insuricare wishes to thank you for your selfless sacrifice through this time of financial uncertainty. It is because of you, the employee, that Insuricare has recorded its highest profit in years. Remember, a successful company makes for successful employees.

{Salutations, Gilbert Huph}

_

Mr. Huph:...a company...

Bob: Is like an enormous clock.

Mr. Huph:...is like an enormous clo--- Yes, precisely! 

Mr. Huph: It only works....if all the little cogs...mesh together!

Mr. Huph: Now, a clock needs to be clean, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] Im being metaphorical, Bob....You know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

Mr. Huph: Bob? Bob...

[Mr. Huph grabs Bob by the chin and pulls him toward him.]

Mr. Huph: LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU, PARR.

[Outside Mr. Huph's office a man is being mugged]

Bob: That man out there, he needs help!

Mr. Huph: Do NOT change the subject, Bob! Were discussing YOUR! ATTITUDE!

Bob: He is getting mugged!

beat

Mr. Huph: Well, lets hope we dont cover him!

[Bob gets up out of his seat and heads for the door.]

Bob: Ill be right back.

[And just when Bob puts his hand on the doorknob, Mr. Huph threatens him:]

Mr. Huph: Stop....RIGHT NOW, OR YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!

[Bob stops; Mr. Huph grins evilly.]

Mr. Huph: Close the door.

[Bob reluctantly does]

Mr. Huph: Get over here....... now.

[Bob lets go of the door knob, now crushed out of shape, and walks over to Mr. Huph.]

Mr. Huph [While Bob watches the mugger getting away]: Im not happy, Bob. Not happy.

Bob: he got away...

Mr. Huph: Good thing, too. Heh! You were this close to losing your j-

[Bob angrily grabs Mr. Huph by the throat and throws him through 4 office walls.]

[Everyone stares at Bob in disbelief.]

Bob:  Uh-oh...

SCENE 12
PA: Please report to operating room 722 immediately.

[Rick Dicker comes out of the room where Gilbert Huph is hospitalized.]

[Bob and Rick conversate while heading to the elevator.]

Bob: How is he?

Rick: Hell live.

Bob: Im fired, arent I?

Rick: Oh, you think?

Bob: What can I say, Rick?

Rick: Nothing you havent said before.

Bob: Someone was in trouble.

Rick: Someones always in trouble.

Bob: I had to do something.

Rick: Yeah. Every time you say those words, it means a month and a half of trouble for me, Bob. It means hundreds of thousands of taxpayers dollars.

[Rick reaches and presses the down elevator button.]

Bob: I know.

Rick: We gotta pay to keep the company quiet. We gotta pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder.

Rick: Money, money, money, money, money, w-we cant keep doing this, Bob! 

Rick [as he enters the Elevator]: We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, youre on your own.

[The door closes, but Rick stops it to say some more words:]

Rick: Uuuum.....Listen, Bob.

Rick: Maybe I could relocate you. You know, for old times sake.

Bob: No. I cant do that to my family. Everyone just got settled. Ill make it work. Thanks.

Rick: Okay. Take care of yourself.

[Bob gets out of the car shuts the door, in one successful try. He turns to the driveway. The same child from before was watching him.]

Bob: Well, what are you waiting for?

Rusty: I dont know..something amazing, I guess....

Bob: [as he sighs] Me too, kid.

SCENE 13
[Bob enters his old office. He pulls out his Insuricare Employee Manual, and rips it in half. He throws it on the trashcan, along with his paper work on his suitcase. While doing so, a strange package hits the can.]

Bob: Huh?

[He opens the package, only to find a tablet. He touches the screen, but something activated on it.]

Bob (reading): Hold still?

[The device emits a sound and a facial recognition scan.]

TABLET: Match: Mr. Incredible.

[He gets startled and throws the tablet on the floor. Unharmed, it scans the room for a few seconds.]

TABLET: Room Is Secure. Commence Message.

Mirage: Hello, Mr. Incredible. Yes, we know who you are. Rest assured, your secret is safe with us. My name is Mirage. We have something in common. According to the government, neither of us exist. Please pay attention, as this message is classified and will not be repeated.

[Mr. Incredible quickly gets to his pencil case and tries to get a pencil, one is not working and then one is normal. He starts taking notes on Mirage's message.]

Mirage: I represent a top secret division of the government, designing and testing experimental technology, and we have need of your unique abilities. Something has happened at our testing facility. (interrupted by Helen: A highly experimental attack robot...)

Helen: Honey!

Bob: Huh? What?

Helen: Dinners ready!

Bob: Okay!

Mirage:...has escaped control. Although it is contained within an isolated area, it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and to our facilities, jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment (interrupted by Helen: in research. Because of its highly sensitive nature, this mission would have not existed.)

Helen: Is someone in there?

Bob: Its the TV, trying to watch.

Helen: Well, stop trying! Its time for dinner!

Bob: [yells] ONE MINUTE!

Mirage: If you accept, your payment will be triple your current annual salary. Call the number on the card. Voice-matching will be used to ensure security. The supers arent gone, Mr. Incredible. Youre still here. You can still do great things. Or you can listen to police gabber. Your choice. You have 24 hours to respond. Think about it.

[The device shuts off.]

[Bob realizes what Mirage said.....and he looks at his past, knowing that this one chance could bring his glory days back....he then looks at his old suit, with a smile.]

[Beeping, as Mirage's phone number is printed.]

TABLET: This Message Will Self-Destruct.

Bob: Uh-oh....

[He stumbles out of the office in a cloud of smoke. The smoke rises and triggers the fire alarm and sprinkler system. Violet shouts off panel, while Dash expresses joy.]

SCENE 14
[Helen was ordering the dining table. He then walks to his husband and idles.]

Helen: You..are one distracted guy.

Bob: Hmm? Am I? I dont mean to be.

Helen: I know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway.

Bob: Honey? About the job?

Helen: What?

Bob: Somethings happened.

Helen: What?

Bob: The, uh...

Helen: What........?

Bob: The company is sending me to, uh, a conference.

Helen: A conference?

Bob [stammering]: Out of town. And Im just gonna be gone for a few days.

Helen: Theyve never sent you to a conference before.....This is good, isnt it?

Bob [hesitating]: Yes.

Helen: You see? Theyre finally recognizing your talents, youre moving up!

Bob: Yes.

Helen: Honey! Awww...This is wonderful!

Bob: Yes, it is.

[phone calling. Mirage's number was shown: 866-787-7476]

Mirage [over phone]: Hello?

Bob: This is Mr. lncredible. Im in.

SCENE 15
[They are inside a futuristic plane. Mirage is briefing Bob's mission.]

Mirage: The Omnidroid 8000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem its confronted with. And, unfortunately...

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders.

Mirage: We lost control. And now its loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. Weve had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): How am I going in?

Mirage: The Omnidroids defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet. lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track. Although were pretty sure its on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): You want me to shut it down without completely destroying it.

Mirage: You are Mr. Incredible.

[Bob is on an advanced seat, he pass his belt on, and the seat shifts into a bed, as it is about to enter a shuttle. However, his belly didn't let him in 6 times. The Soldier then increases the seat power and it successfully gets Mr. Incredible in the shuttle.]

Mirage: Ive got to warn you, its a learning robot. Every moment you spend fighting it only increases its knowledge of how to beat you.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Shut it down. Do it quickly. Dont destroy it.

Mirage: And dont die.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Great. Thanks.

[The shuttle ejects. It rockets down the island. After stopping, it propels with two blades. After a while, it lands. Mr. Incredible tries to get out, but his belly won't let him out. He goes back in, and punches the shuttle in half. He flexes and gets ready.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Showtime..

[He explores through the jungle, trying to find the Omnidroid.]

[He sees a blade mark on a tree and a cross on the grass. Suddenly, the Omnidroid suprises him from behind, as it tries to impale him unsuccessfully. It slashes a 3rd time, only cutting a mark on Mr. Incredible's arm. Mr. Incredible leaps over the robot, and throws a punch that sends it flying to a tree.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible) [gruntingly]: Yeah!

[The robot gets up, and the real fight begins.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Uh oh....

[The robot charges at him, as he leaps over. The robot unfortunately calculated his leaping arc, and that allowed it to swat him mid-air, slamming Mr. Incredible into another tree that topped onto the Omnidroid. But the robot rolled out of its way, and reformed. The robot curled up again to crush him, only for Mr. Incredible to dodge it, as it knocks down some trees before charging at him quickly. Mr. Incredible sprints his way off, but he almost gets crushed by the robot as he jumps over a cliff, slides on it, and lands.The Omnidroid arrives at a similar pace, as he recieves a boulder from our hero. The Omnidroid does the same 3 times, the latter hitting Mr. Incredible. It almost impales him unsuccessfully. Its claw is lodged in the cliff, as the hero runs for safety. The Omnidroid pulls its limb out of the cliff and leaped high into the air, intent on crushing Mr. Incredible, who leaped out of the way and landed in the lava fields. The Omnidroid lands and makes an attempt to push Mr. Incredible into the lava as he tried to push back. After a few seconds however, he lets out a scream while using his maximum strength and jerk-pulls the robot aside into the lava.]

[Bob laughs in what he thought was his victory, but after trying to spin, his spine cracks.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): AH!- ow, ow, ow. Oh my back!

[The Omnidroid suddenly bursts out of the lava through a place of the stone platform, making it crack. It proceeds to spin its claws, as Mr. Incredible leaps on a chunk of rock. But then the Omnidroid grabbed him by his feet with one of its claws and slammed him to the ground before grabbing his arms with another. It began to pull him apart... until it stops when it accidentally fixed his back.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): O-oh...Hahaha!

[He then jack-knives, ripping the claw off its arms. He runs under the robot, as it uses his lower sensor cluster. Just as it spots its target, he rips it off, and climbs inside the robot, as it unintentionally starts damaging itself. After a while, it stops, weakened. Mr. Incredible punched off its upper sensor cluster, as it whistles while riding the robot. The robot tries to pull him out, but it accidentally tears its brainpan out. Mr. Incredible jumps out of the robot and casually walks away, as the Omnidroid motionlessly falls down.]

[A mecha-macaw watched everything, as it zooms to the screen.]

Syndrome: Surprising. We must bring him back. Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner.

SCENE 16
[Mr. Incredible is in a pod, inside the volcano's magma flows. He waits for Mirage in a huge dining room, while peeking to see who the mysterious man was.]

Syndrome (very quietly): Most important, keep things light. Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities.

[He hides back and pretends to have waited long enough.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Am I overdressed?

Mirage: Actually, you look rather dashing.

[They head to the dining table and sit.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I take it our host is...

Mirage: Oh, Im sorry. He wont be dining with us. He hopes youll understand.

Bob (Mr. Incredible):Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who Im working for.

Mirage: He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of all people understand that.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why live...

Mirage: With a volcano? Hes attracted to power. So am I. Its a weakness we share.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Seems a bit unstable.

Mirage: I prefer to think of it as misunderstood.

Bob (Mr. Incredible) [chuckling]: Arent we all?

Mirage: Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Everythings delicious.

[Life's incredible again.]

Bob [no voice]: Go long!!!

Dash [no voice]: I got it!

SCENE 17
BOB: Ah, jeez.

HELEN [o.s.]: Hurry, honey! Or youll be late for work!

HELEN: Have a great day, honey.

BOB: Thanks.

HELEN: Help customers, climb ladders...

BOB: Bring bacon?

HELEN: All that jazz.

(Bob drives away. The camera then shows the gate of another house on top of a hill. A screen displays a video feed of a guard.)

GUARD: You have an appointment?

BOB: Im an old friend. I just wanted to...

GUARD: All visitors are required to make a reser--

E: (shoos the guard away) Hey, get back to work! Go check the electric fence or something!

E: What is it? Who are you? What do you want?

BOB: [lowers his sunglasses]

E: My God, youve gotten fat. Come in, Come, come! (Gates open)

(Now Bob and E walk down a hallway.)

E: Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all.

BOB: Werent you just in the news? Some show in Prayge...Prague?

E: Milan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. HA! Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. FEH! I used to design for gods! ...... But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call.

BOB: E, I just need a patch job.

E: Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And youve torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work?

BOB: Must have happened a long time ago.

E: I see. This is a hobo suit. Darling, you cant be seen in this! I wont allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?

BOB: What do you mean? You designed it.

E: I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain.

BOB: A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit?

E: You can't! Its impossible! Im far too busy. So ask me now, before I again become sane.

BOB: Wait.... you want to make me... a suit?

E: You push too hard, darling! But I accept.

E: It will be bold. Dramatic!

BOB: Yeah.

E: Heroic!

BOB: Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots-

E: No capes! [She throws a paper ball to him.]

[This puzzles Bob.]

BOB: Isnt that my decision?

E: Do you remember Thunderhead? Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids.

BOB: Listen, E...

E: November 15th of 58. All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

BOB: Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb...

E: Stratogale! April 23rd, 57. Cape caught in a jet turbine.

BOB: E, you cant generalize about these things.

E: Meta Man, Express elevator! Dynaguy, snagged on takeoff! Splashdown, sucked into a vortex! NO CAPES! Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment.

BOB: You know Im retired from hero work.

E: As am l, Robert. Yet, here we are.

BOB: E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons.

E: (she sighs) fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

BOB: Youre the best of the best, E.

E: Yes, I know, darling. (whispering) I know.

SCENE 18
[phone rings]


BOB

I got it, I got it! Dont answer it, honey, I got it!


BOB

Hello?


MIRAGE

We have a new assignment for you. How soon can you get here?


BOB

Ill leave tomorrow morning.


MIRAGE

BOB

Goodbye.


HELEN

Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?


BOB

Another conference. Short notice, but you know...duty calls. [nervous laugh]


HELEN

BOB

Yeah, whats up, honey?


HELEN

Ha....have a great trip.


BOB

Thanks, sweetie. Ill call you when I get there.


HELEN

I love you. So much.


BOB

I love you too.

(BOB is on Syndrome's Manta Jet.)

COMPUTER: This Is Your Automated, Captain. Would You Care For More Mmimosa?

Mr. Incredible: Dont mind if I do. Thanks.

COMPUTER: Youre Welcome.


COMPUTER

Currently 78 Degrees In Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying.


COMPUTER

Please fasten your seat belt. Were beginning our descent.


MIRAGE: Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Thanks. Nice to be back, Mirage.

MIRAGE: Youll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at two. D Wing, room A-113.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): 2:00. Got it.

MIRAGE: See you there.

(HELEN vacuums the hallway next to BOB's study. She vacuums the carpet near the door, hears the vacuum pick up filth and groans before entering the room. She begins to vacuum the study and notices the door displaying BOB's old super suit is open. She observes the suit and notices a a tear in the right arm of the suit has been fixed)

HELEN

[gasps] Edna.

SCENE 19
HELEN: I'd like to speak with Edna.

E: This is Edna.

HELEN: E? This is Helen.

E: Helen who?

HELEN: Helen Parr? You know.... Elastigirl.

E: Darling! Its been such a long time after all these years! So long!

HELEN: Yes, yes, yes. Its been a while. Listen, theres only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit and thats you.

E: Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isnt it? Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. They are finished. When are you coming to see?

HELEN: Look, Im calling about...

E: Dont make me beg, darling. I wont do it, you know.

HELEN: Beg? Uh, no. Im calling about suit. Ab-about Bobs suit! Im calling about Bobs suit!

E: You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

SCENE 20
(Bob enters in a meeting room.)

(He waits quietly for anyone, as he looks around)

(But suddenly, the Omnidroid v.X9 attacks him out of nowhere, and it throws him)

Syndrome: Its bigger! (The Omnidroid throws him again) Its badder! (And again) Ladies and gentlemen, it's.... (And again, this time it grabs Mr. Incredible and it uses its two tentacles to decapitate him, which it almost does) Too much for Mr. Incredible!!! (Syndrome reveals himself.) Whoa, Whoa! Whoa! Its finally ready! (He shuts down the blades of the Omnidroid.) You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasnt good enough!! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all....... I am your biggest fan.

(Bob suddenly recognizes some familiarity with his rejected sidekick)

MR. INCREDIBLE: Buddy?

SYNDROME: [angrily yells at Mr. Incredible] My name is not..... BUDDY!!!!!

(The Omnidroid throws Bob on the floor. Syndrome lands.)

SYNDROME: And its not lncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I only wanted to help! And WHAT did you say to me??!!?

(Flashback starts)

MR. INCREDIBLE: Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

SYNDROME (as the flashback ends): It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You cant count on anyone. Especially your heroes.

MR. INCREDIBLE: [sadly] I was wrong to treat you that way. Im sorry.

SYNDROME: See? Now you respect me, because Im a threat. Thats the way it works! Turns out theres a lot of people, whole countries who want respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it. How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons. And now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, Ill get--

(Mr. Incredible throws a log at Syndrome, but he dodges it hastily. He gets back up and freezes Mr. Incredible with something)

SYNDROME: [laughing] You sly dog! You got me monologuing! I cant believe it. (He slams Mr. Incredible into the floor.) Its cool, huh? Zero-point energy. I saved the best inventions for myself. (He starts throwing Bob around with his ZPE arm.) Am I good enough NOW?! Whos super NOW?!?! Im Syndrome! Your nemesis and e-!

(Syndrome makes a grandiose gesture with his arms, inadvertently flinging Mr. Incredible into the jungle.)

SYNDROME: Oh, brilliant.

(Bob lands somewhere in the water. Syndrome spots him and flies towards him. Bob jumps down while Syndrome watches him falling into the bade of a waterfall. He taps a button in his wrist cuffs, which activates a tiny bomb.)

SYNDROME: All right, try this one on for size, big boy.

(He drops it to the base of the waterfall.)

(Bob spots the bomb as he tries to swim away from it, although he is soon caught in the blast)

(He emerges out of the water, gasping, in a cave system. He turns his head, and leaps back, realizing he is face to face with a skeleton. Slowly, he moves back towards the skeleton, noticing that it has an eye visor and a cape.)

MR. INCREDIBLE: Gazerbeam.

(He looks in the direction of Gazerbeam's gaze and sees a pattern carved into the rocks. He reads out a word of the pattern.)

MR. INCREDIBLE: Kronos?

(He suddenly hears a probe entering the cave. He hides behind Gazerbeam's skeleton. The probe scans the room, does a quick of Gazerbeam's skeleton and leaves. The view cuts to the probe returning to Syndrome's wrist cuff.)

PROBE: Life readings negative. Mr. Incredible terminated.

(He walks away with a satisfied smile...)

SCENE 21
(E and Helen are walking down a hallway)

EDNA MODE: This project has completely confiscated my life, darling. Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit. Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

HELEN: E, I just...

E: I did Roberts suit, and it turned out so beautiful, I had to continue.

HELEN: E, Its great to see you, but I gotta tell you I have no idea what youre talking about. I just...

E: Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That is why you are here!

[She adresses some scanning and coding...]

E: Edna Mode.

(An assortment of weapons aim at Helen, who gets on defensive pose)

E: And guest. (The weapons retreat)

(E and HELEN walk into room with a sitting area and a large glass wall, separating them from an area with three white walls.)

E: Come. Sit.

EDNA MODE: Cream and sugar?

HELEN: Thanks.

EDNA MODE: I started with the baby.

HELEN: Started?

EDNA MODE: Shh! Darling! Shh! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, and can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. Thats a new feature.

HELEN: What on earth.... do you think the baby will be doing?!

EDNA MODE: Well, Im sure I dont know, darling. Luck favors the prepared. I didnt know the babys powers, so I covered the basics.

HELEN: Jack-Jack doesnt have any powers.

EDNA MODE: No? Well, hell look fabulous anyway.


EDNA MODE

Your boys suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature.


EDNA MODE

Your daughters suit was tricky. But I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does.


EDNA MODE

Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible... yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think?

HELEN: What do I think? Bob is retired! Im retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?!

EDNA MODE: Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep secrets from you?

HELEN: He wouldnt. Didnt. Doesnt.

EDNA MODE: Men at Roberts age are often unstable. Prone to weakness.

HELEN: What are you saying?

EDNA MODE: Do you know where he is?

Helen: Of.... cours-

EDNA MODE: Do you KNOW.... where he is?

SCENE 22
[voices, static on radio]


[electric fizzling]


[grunt]


[voice on radio]


GUARD 1

Hey, hey. We got a man down!


GUARD 2

Come on, lets go.


GUARD 2

Are you okay? What happened?


[over radio] Break surveillance and engage. Continuing sweep...

[Bob sprints in the closing lava hallway, then jumps as a door closes. A pathway is slowly lightened up, leading up to a keyboard. He slowly walks to it, and presses enter.]

[Remembering the password from Gazerbeam's gaze before his death at the cave he ended up on, he types it. The Computer is logged in to a menu.]

[Switch back to Helen and Edna Mode.]

WOMAN [over phone]: Insuricare.

HELEN: Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr. Bob Parr is my husband. I was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel hes staying at? The number I have is no good.

WOMAN: Mr. Parr no longer works at Insuricare.

HELEN: What do you mean? Hes on a business trip. A company retreat.

WOMAN: My records say his employment was terminated almost two months ago.

[Switch back to Bob. After apparently searching one of the information sectors, he proceeds to go to the ''Supers'' sector. He presses return, and it's a slideshow of the superheroes and the older Omnidroids.]

[The sequence is as it follows:]

[Universal Man - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X1]

[Psycwave - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X1]

[Everseer - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X1]

[Macroburst - Terminated the Omnidroid v.X1]

[Macroburst - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X2]

[Phylangue - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X2]

[Blazestone - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X2]

[Switch back to Helen and Edna. Helen's call ends, as she worries for Bob.]

[Switch back again to Bob in the Computer room. The sequence continues....:]

[Downburst - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X3]

[Hyper Shock - Terminated the Omnidroid v.X3]

[Hyper Shock - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Apogee - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Unknown Super - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Blitzerman - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Tradewind - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Vectress - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Unknown Super - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X4]

[Gazerbeam - Terminated the Omnidroid v.X4]

[Gazerbeam - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X5]

[Stormicide - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X5]

[Gamma Jack - Terminated the Omnidroid v.X5]

[Gamma Jack - Terminated by Omnidroid v.X6]

[Unknown Super - Terminated the Omnidroid v.X6]

[Switch back to Helen and Edna.]


E: So, you dont know where he is. [shows a tracking device to Helen] Would you like to find out?

[Switch back to Bob, with the sequence ended.]

[He types "Elastigirl" into the search engine and the screen displays her location as "UNKNOWN". He gives a relieved sigh.]

[He then types ''Frozone'' into the search engine and the screen displays his location as ''KNOWN''. Shortly after, he types himself on the search engine. The screen displays him as ''TERMINATED'' by the Omnidroid v.X9.]

[Cut back to Edna and Helen. Edna gives the tracker device to Helen.]

[Cut back to Mr. Incredible in the Computer Room. He types something and then Operation Kronos's sequence begins. It shows the Omnidroid v.10. Then, Mr. Incredible goes to the phases:]

[First Phase: Secure the Omnidroid into a Rocketship.]

[Second Phase: Launch the Rocket towards Metroville.]

[Third Phase: Destroy the city with the robot deployed.]

[The countdown begins, having 8 hours left until the Omnidroid is launched. Mr. Incredible retreats. Cut Back to Helen. She presses the tracking device and Bob's suit light blinks. The lights turn on, and turret holes open up as a P.A repeats thrice: Intruder Alert.]

[The Turrets shoot a sticky, expanding and pressure absorbent orbs that hit him. He stops twice because of the orbs hitting him too much. He collapses just as he was at the door.]

SCENE 23
HELEN: [sobbing] Oh, I am such an idiot. I let this happen, you know...The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, THE LIES.......

E: Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

HELEN: Now Im losing him! Whatll I do? Whatll I do?

E: What are you talking about?

HELEN: Hmm...............?

E: YOU ARE ELASTIGIRL!! My God. (Hitting HELEN with a newspaper) Pull! Yourself! Together! What will you do, Is...is-is this a question?!? You will show him you remember that he is Mr. lncredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you don't know where he is, go, confront the problem! Fight! WIN! And call me when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits.

(Helen is at the Parr house, talking with Violet while walking down the hallway to her bedroom)

HELEN: Theres lots of leftovers that you can reheat. Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on time. I should be back tonight. Late. You can be in charge that long, cant you?

VIOLET: Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

HELEN: Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy.

VIOLET: You mean Dads in trouble, or Dad is the trouble?

HELEN: I mean either hes in trouble, or hes going to be.


Dash: Hey! Whats that? Whered you get that, Mom? You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us? We all get cool outfits? Ha-ha!

Helen: Dash! You come back here this moment!

[phone rings]

Helen: Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. Listen, I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could get you to...

Violet: What are these? (Holds up a red costume, similiar to BOB's new super suit)

(Helen takes the suit from Violet)

Dash: (Dressed in one of the suits and looking at himself in the mirror) Look, Im The Dash! The Dash likes this.

Helen: Just a second. (To DASH) Take that off before somebody sees it.

Violet: But youre packing one just like it. Are you hiding something?

Helen: Oh, please, honey. Im on the phone...

Dash: (snags one of the suits) Yikes!

Helen: Dash!

Dash: (Handing a suit to Violet) Yikes! This is yours. Its specially made.

Violet: Whats going on?

Helen: (Shoving both kids out of the bedroom) Youre not coming! And Ive gotta pack!!!


Violet: What makes you think its special?

Dash: I dont know. Whyd Mom try to hide it?

(Violet makes her arm vanish. She touches the suit and the suit vanishes. She gasps.)

Helen: Snug, Im calling in a solid you owe me.

Snug [over phone]: What do you need?

Helen: A jet. What do you got thats fast?

Snug [over phone]: Let me think...

SCENE 24
(Helen is in the pilot seat of an airplane.)

Helen: Island approach. India Golf Niner-Niner checking in. VFR on top. Over.

[radio static]

Helen: Island tower, this is India Golf Niner-Niner requesting vectors to the initial. Over.

[radio static]

Helen: Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. Youre overreacting. Everythings fine. Theyre just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah.

[She heads to a room to put the suit on.]

(The camera cuts to Mr. Incredible being imprisoned by a suspension system by his limbs. Syndrome walks towards him.)

Syndrome: You, sir....truly are Mr. Incredible. You know, I was right to idolize you. I... I-I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super??? OH, MAN! Im still geeking out about it! ... [sighs] ... And then you had to just go and..... ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help? [mocking] "Help me, help me." Lame, lame, lame, lame, LAME!!! ALL RIGHT! WHO DID YOU CONTACT?!?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Contact? What are you talking about?

(He gets him electrocuted.)

Syndrome: I am referring to last night at 23:07 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I didnt know about the homing device.

(He gets him electrocuted again.)

Syndrome: And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here! Who did you contact?!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I didnt send for a... a plane.

Syndrome: Play the transmission!

Helen: ...India golf Niner-Niner checking in. VFR on top. Over.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Helen...

Syndrome: So you do know these people. Well, then, Ill send them a little greeting.

(Helen throws her bag on one of the seats.)

Violet: Ow!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Violet?!

Violet: Its not my fault! Dash ran away, and I knew Id get blamed for it--

Dash: Thats not true!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Dash?!

Violet/Dash:	[Violet]...and I thought hed try to sneak on the plane so I came here and you closed the doors before I could find him and then you took off and [to Dash] its not my fault!
[Dash] You said, "Somethings up with Mom. We have to find out what!" It was your idea! Your idea! Hundred percent all-yours, all-the-time idea!"
Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Wait a minute, wait a minute. You left JACK-JACK alone?!

Violet/Dash:	[Violet] Yes, mom, Im completely stupid... Of course we got a sitter! Do you think Im totally irresponsible? Thanks a lot!
[Dash] No, we got someone, Mom. Someone great. We wouldnt do that.
Helen (Mrs. Incredible): All right! Well, whod you get?


Kari: You dont have to worry about one single thing, Mrs. Parr. Ive got this baby-sitting thing wired. Ive taken courses and learned CPR and I got excellent marks and certificates...

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Kari...

Kari: I also brought Mozart to play while he sleeps to make him smarter because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Kari...

Kari: And the beauty part is that the babies dont even have to listen cause theyre asleep! You know, I wish my parents played Mozart when I slept because half the time I dont even know what the heck anyones talking about.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Kari, I really dont feel comfortable with this. Ill pay you for your trouble, but Id really rather call a service.

Kari: Oh, theres really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out. [cooing] Cant I, little baby? I can handle it. Who can handle it?

(Helen looks on the plane radar and sees several missiles headed towards the plane.)

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): India Golf Niner-Niner transmitting in the blind guard. Disengage! Repeat, disengage!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Disengage! Repeat, disengage! Friendlies...

Bob (Mr. Incredible): [begging Syndrome] No! Call off the missiles, I'll do anything!

Syndrome: Too late! (he shrugs) .... Fifteen years too late. (As he walks evilly towards him)


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Friendlies at two-zero miles south-southwest of your position. Angels 10. Track east. Disengage! [to Violet] Vi! You have to put a force field around the plane!

Violet: But you said we werent supposed to use our powers!!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): I KNOW WHAT I SAID! Listen to what Im saying NOW! Disengage. Repeat, disengage!


Dash: Mom?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): VIOLET!!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Mayday, mayday! India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked! Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, there are children aboard!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): NO!!!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): [to Violet] PUT A FIELD AROUND US NOW!!!!!!!

Violet: [interrupts] But Mom, Ive never done one that big before!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): VIOLET, DO IT NOW!!!!!!!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Abort, abort, abort!

(Violet attempts to create a force-field but the force-field never gets any larger than the size of her head)

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Abort, abort, abort!

(The Plane explodes and Helen wraps around Violet and Dash. The three begin falling towards the ocean.)

[all screaming]


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Brace yourselves!

(Helen blanks out for a moment and notices the kids screaming. She emerges to see the two kids treading water.)

Violet/Dash: Mom! Mom!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Everybody calm down. Now, Ill tell you what were not gonna do. Were not gonna panic, were not gonna--LOOK OUT!!!!!!!!

(A turbine hits About 10 meters away from where the three are. Helen pushes Dash and Violet underwater. Dash and Violet swim back to the surface and Helen watches the turbine hit the bottom and explode before swimming back up.)

Dash/Violet:	[Dash] Oh, my gosh! Whos idea was this anyway?!
[Violet] What-do-we-do-what-do-we-do-what-do-we-do?!
Dash: Were dead! Were dead!

Violet: It blew up!

Dash: We survived but were dead!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): STOP IT!!!

Helen (Mrs. Incredibles) We are NOT gonna die! Now BOTH of you will GET A GRIP. Or SO help me I will GROUND you for a month! UNDERSTAND?!?!?!?

(Back to the interrogation room.)

Mirage: We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed.

SYNDROME: Ah, youll get over it... I seem to recall you prefer to.... work..... alone.......? (Syndrome evil laugh as he walks away.)

(Bob becomes enraged.)

(Mirage gasps, and with quick thinking she pushes Syndrome as Bob suddenly grabs her. Syndrome quickly stands up.)

Bob (Mr. Incredible): RELEASE ME. NOW!!!!

SYNDROME: Or what?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Ill crush her.

SYNDROME: Ooh. That sounds a little dark for you. Nah, go ahead.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): (as Mirage gasps and he presses her harder) Itll be easy...like breaking a toothpick.

SYNDROME: (chuckles) Show me.

(As Syndrome amusedly waits, Bob slowly loses his will. He then sighs and releases Mirage, as she falls to the floor and looks shocked to Syndrome.)

SYNDROME: I knew you couldnt do it. Even when you have nothing to lose! Youre weak!.... (He walks away) ...and Ive outgrown you.

(As Mirage looks to Bob one more time with a worried expression, she leaves with Syndrome as Bob starts crying, thinking that he lost his family.)

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Those were short-range missiles. Land-based. That way is our best bet.

Dash: You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): If it means land, yes.

Violet: Do you expect us to swim there?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): I expect you....... to trust me.


(Dash is hastily pushing Helen morphed onto a boat, as Violet sits on her.)

SCENE 25
(The three make it to shore)

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): What a trooper... Im so proud of you.

Dash: Thanks, mom.


(Cut to the cave)

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): I think... your father is in trouble.

Violet: If you havent noticed, mom, were not doing so hot either.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Im going to look for him. And that means youre in charge until I get back, Violet.

Dash: What?!

Violet: You heard her.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Put these on. (Hands the two masks) Your identity is your most valuable possession. Protect it. And if anything goes wrong, use your powers.

Violet: But you said never to use...

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): I know what I said! [sighs] Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They wont exercise restraint because youre children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance.

Violet: Mom?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Vi, Im counting on you.

Violet: Theres something I...

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Im counting on you. Be strong. Dash, if anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can.

Dash: As fast as I can?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. Ill be back by morning.

[...]

Violet: Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane? Im sorry. [stammering] I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to... Im sorry.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Shh. It isnt your fault. It wasnt fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we cant afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Dont think. And dont worry. If the time comes, youll know what to do. Its in your blood.


(Cut to MIRAGE)

MIRAGE

Hes not weak, you know.


SYNDROME

What?


MIRAGE

Valuing life is not weakness.


SYNDROME

Oh, hey. Look, look...if youre talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control.


MIRAGE

And disregarding it is not a strength.


SYNDROME

I called his bluff, sweetheart, thats all. I knew he wouldnt have it in him to actually...


MIRAGE

Next time you gamble, bet your own life!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Okay, okay, okay.


[voices on radio]


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): A rocket?


[sighs, gasps]



GUARD

Hey!


[struggling]



DASH

Well, not that this isnt fun, but Im gonna go look around.


VIOLET

What do you think is going on here? You think were on vacation or something? Mom and Dads lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, [whispering] their marriage.


DASH

Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dads marriage.


VIOLET

Oh, forget it. Youre so immature.


DASH

Okay, Im gonna go look around.


VIOLET

Mom said to stay hidden.


DASH

Im not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh!


[voices over radio]


DASH

[echoing] Cool!!


DASH

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): [gasps] Bob.


GUARD 1: Huh? What?

GUARD 2: Uh, I didnt say anything.

SCENE 26
ROBOT: Identification, please.

DASH: Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look.

VIOLET: What?

DASH: It talks!

VIOLET: What?

DASH: There. That one.

ROBOT: Voice key incorrect.

ROBOT: Voice key incorrect.

VIOLET: Wait a second...

[alarm sounds]

DASH: What do we do?

VIOLET: Run!

DASH: Where are we going?

VIOLET: Away from here!

[PA] Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

[Mirage releases Mr. Incredible. She slowly walks to him.]

Mirage: There isnt much time.

[Mr. Incredible suddenly grabs her by her neck.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): No, there isnt. In fact, theres no time at all.

Mirage: [choking] ..Please.....

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Why are you here. How can you...possibly bring me lower? What more can you take away from me?

Mirage: [choking] ...The.... family..... survived... th.... crash..! Theyre here......on the island........!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Theyre alive?

[Mr. Incredible drops her, as she is coughing. He then picks her up, and hugs her, much to the two's comfort.]

[Mirage quielty gasps, as Helen arrived on the scene.]

[Mr. Incredible drops Mirage by her feet.]

Mirage: Oh, hello....You must be Mrs. Incre--[She gets knocked out cold before she could finish, much to Mr. Incredible's shock.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): She was helping me to escape!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): No! Thats what I was doing.

[Mr. Incredible grabs her husband's arm.]

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Let go of me! Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep---!

[They kiss.]

Bob (Mr. Incredible): How could I betray the perfect woman?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Oh, youre referring to me now?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Where are the kids?


MIRAGE: They mightve triggered the alert.


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): What?!


MIRAGE: Securitys been sent into the jungle. You better get going.


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Now our kids are in danger?!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): If you suspected danger, whyd you bring them?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): I didnt bring em, they stowed away. And I dont think youre not striking the proper tone here!

[...]

GUARD: Think theyre supers?

VIOLET: Dash, remember what Mom said.

DASH: What?

GUARD 2: Hey! Stop talking!

GUARD 3: Hold it! Freeze!

VIOLET: Dash, run!

DASH: What?

VIOLET: Run!

DASH: Oh yeah! (he runs away)

GUARD: What the--?! Theyre supers!

(VIOLET disappears)

GUARD 2: Get the boy! Show yourself!


[spitting]


[Dash screams]


GUARD

Hey!


DASH

Ha, ha!


DASH

Im alive. Yeah!


[Dash shouting]


DASH

Uh-oh.


[water sloshing]


Bob (Mr. Incredible): I shouldve told you I was fired, I admit it. But I didnt want you to worry.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): You didnt want me to worry? And now were running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): You keep trying to pick a fight, but Im still just happy youre alive.


(Cut to GUARD)

GUARD

I know youre there, Little Miss Disappear.

(The water splashes)

GUARD

You cant hide from me.

(The guard throws a bit of sand into the water. The sand trails in a certain shape.)

GUARD

(Aiming gun) There you are.


DASH

(Hitting GUARD) Hey!!!


DASH

(Punching GUARD) Dont touch my sister!!!

(A second GUARD points a gun at DASH. The GUARD fires and VIOLET jumps between them creating a forcefield that encases her and DASH)

Dash: How are you doing that?!

Violet: I dont know!

Dash: Whatever you do, dont stop! (he runs, moving the ball.)

(Cut to HELEN and BOB who are run over by the kids)

Violet: Mom! Dad! Hey!

(The forcefield disappears)

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Kids! Youre all right.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Oh, youre all right!

Violet: We were so worried about you!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I thought Id never see you again.


Bob (Mr. Incredible) and Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Aww, I love you.

Dash: Wow.

Violet: Whoa.

(The family encounters a group of guards. As they strike a fighting pose, they battle them.)

Syndrome: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! HEY, TIME OUT!

(Until Syndrome arrives and freezes the entire family with both of his ZPE gloves.)

Syndrome: What have we here? Matching uniforms?

Syndrome: Oh, no..... Elastigirl!?

(He mockingly laughs)

Syndrome: You married Elastigirl? Whoa.... and got.....busy!!! Its a whole family of supers! Looks like Ive hit the jackpot! Oh, this is just too good!

SCENE 27
- [on TV] The ships unique design suggests...

- [on TV] There were no fatalities...

(The family is now put into the suspension system.)

SYNDROME: Huh? Huh!? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool!

SYNDROME: Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! Ill be a bigger hero than you ever were!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): You mean, you killed off real heroes so that you could....... PRETEND TO BE ONE?

SYNDROME: Oh, Im real. Real enough to defeat YOU! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. Ill give them heroics. Ill give them the most spectacular heroics anyones ever seen! And when Im old and Ive had my fun, Ill sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be a super! And when everyones super....no one will be. [evil laughter] [leaves room]

[soldiers shouting]

SOLDIER: Fire at will!

(The Omnidroid starts destroying the Military troops with ease.)

- [on TV] Its completely overwhelming the tanks.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Im sorry. This is my fault. Ive been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued that I undervalued all of you.

Dash: Um... Dad?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Shh. Dont interrupt.

(Violet uses her forcefield to nullify the zero point energy's effects and float out of the suspension system. She walks towards the keyboard.)

Bob (Mr. Incredible): So caught up in the past that I....... You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, Im gonna get us out of this safely if I..........

Violet: Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think its time we wind down now.

(She hits the control panel, releasing the family)

Bob (Mr. Incredible): We need to get back to the mainland.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead, I think.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Where are all the guards?

(The guards are all holed up in an RV, watching the omnidroid reports on TV.)

(Mr. Incredible is signaling family to move inside the RV) Go, go!

GUARD: Hey, look. Hey! Every time they run, you take a shot.

GUARD 2: Yeah, okay.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): This is the right hangar, but I dont see any jets.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): A jets not fast enough.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Whats faster than a jet?

Dash: Hey, how about a rocket?


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Great! I cant fly a rocket.

Violet: You dont have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch.


Bob (Mr. Incredible) Ah, wait. I bet Syndromes changed the password by now. How do I get into the computer?

Mirage: Say "please".

SCENE 28
(Lucius sees the Omnidroid outside his apartment)

Lucius: Honey??

Honey Best: What??

Lucius: Wheres my supersuit!?

Honey Best: What!?

Lucius: WHERE!.... IS! MY! SUPER! SUIT?!!??

Honey Best: I.. uh..... put it away.

Lucius: Where!?!?

Honey Best: Why do you need to know?!

Lucius: I NEED IT!!!

Honey Best: Uh-uh! Dont you think about running off doing no derrin-do! Weve been planning this dinner for two months!

Lucius: The public is in danger!!

Honey Best: My evenings in danger!!

Lucius: YOU TELL ME WHERE MY SUIT IS, WOMAN!! WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD!!!!

Honey Best: Greater good? I am your wife! Im the greatest good you are ever gonna get!!

(Cuts back to the Omnidroid destroying the city)

Man: RUN!!!

(A woman runs towards a carriage in the path of a piece of building)

Woman: My baby!

(Syndrome holds the tanker in place just above the carriage and woman.)

Man: The supers have returned!

Woman: Is that Fironic?

Man: Fironic?

Woman: No, Fironic has a different outfit!

Syndrome: No, no, Im a new superhero! Im SYNDROME! (He flicks away the truck as it explodes. The omnidroid moves towards him.) All right, stand back! (He starts ''fighting'' his own Omnidroid) Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal..... a few manners. (He detaches his robot's arm to pretend that he used his fake strength.) Ha, ha!

(The Omnidroid scans the place, his detached arm, and aims at Syndrome's wrist, becoming self-aware.)

(It shoots the control glove off, and he starts attacking Syndrome, damaging one of his rocket boots.)

(Syndrome flies out of control and he crashes onto a building. He lands, tries to get up and falls unconsious soon after.)

Dash: Are we there yet?


Bob (Mr. Incredible): We get there when we get there.


Bob (Mr. Incredible): HOW YOU DOING, HONEY?!?!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): DO I HAVE TO ANSWER?!?!?!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Here we go, honey!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Ready, Violet? Ready? Now!!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): UGGGH!!!!!!!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): This is gonna be rough!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): The robots in the financial district. Which exit do I take?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Traction Avenue.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Thatll take me downtown. I take Seventh, dont I?

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): DONT TAKE SEVENTH!!!!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Great, we missed it!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): You asked me how to get there and I told you. Exit at Traction!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Thatll take me downtown!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Hes coming up! GET IN THE RIGHT LANE! SIGNAL!!!!!!

Bob (Mr. Incredible): NOT TRACTION!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): YOU'RE NOT GONNA MISS IT!!!!!!!!!!


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Is everybody okay back there?

VIOLET: Super-duper, Dad!

DASH: [laughing] Lets do that again.


[people screaming]


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Wait here and stay hidden. Im going in.


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): While what?? I watch helplessly from the sidelines? I dont think so.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Im asking you to wait with the kids.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): And Im telling you not a chance. Youre my husband. Im with you for better or worse.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I have to do this alone!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): What is this to you? Playtime?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): No.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): So you can be Mr. Incredible again?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): NO!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Then what? What is it?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Im not...

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Not what?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Im not strong enough.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Strong enough. And this will make you stronger?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): Yes. NO!!

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Thats what this is? Some sort of workout!?

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I CAN'T LOSE YOU AGAIN!!! (he grabs Helen and shook her, then he stops.) I can't. Not again. Im not....... strong enough.

(they kiss)

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): If we work together, you wont have to be.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): I dont know whatll happen.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Hey. Were superheroes. What can happen?

Violet: [screaming]

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): VI!!!!! DASH!!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

VIOLET

It doesnt work!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Kids!

OLD MAN

Hey, did you see that? Eh? Thats the way to do it. Thats old school.


OLD MAN 2

Yeah. No school like the old school.


LUCIUS (FROZONE)

Just like old times.


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Just like old times [gives Frozone a heavy pat on the back]


LUCIUS (FROZONE)

Oh! Yeah. Hurt then too.

SCENE 29
RICK: Weve frozen all of Syndromes assets. lf he even sneezes, well be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The people of this country are indebted to you.


Bob (Mr. Incredible): Does this mean we can come out of hiding?


RICK Let the politicians figure that one out. But Ive been asked to assure you well take care of everything else. You did good, Bob.

DASH Hey, mom! That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm and kinda whiplashed him into the other guy. It was so sweet!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Honey, uh, yeah, Im trying to listen to messages, honey.

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Bob, listen to this.

Bob (Mr. Incredible): "Special needs"?


RICK Here we are.


[Kari] - Anyway, thanks for sending a replacement sitter.


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Replacement? I didnt call for a replacement!


SYNDROME: Shhhhh................................ The baby is sleeping. (he chuckles wickedly) You took away my future. Im simply returning the favor. Oh, dont worry, Ill be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything that you werent. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. Ha ha!


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Hes getting away, Bob! We have to do something! We have to do something now!

SYNDROME: NO!!!


SYNDROME: This isnt the end of it! I will get your son, eventually. Ill get your son!

(Bob's supercar is seen flying towards Syndrome's ship)


SYNDROME: Oh, no.

(The car explodes, and Syndrome dodges it, but his cape gets caught on his ship's turbine force as it pulls him in)

(As he panics to get out, he struggles harder, but the force gets him as the turbine's blades liquify him. The ship starts to explode)


Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Look at Mommy, honey. Dont look down. Mommys got you. Everything is all right.


[...]

Helen (Mrs. Incredible): Thats my girl.


DASH: Does this mean we have to move again?


RUSTY: Oh, man..... THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED!!!!!!!!
